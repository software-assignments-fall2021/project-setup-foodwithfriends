Are you going out to eat with friends anytime soon? These friendly gatherings usually go one of two ways: a restaurant is agreed upon fairly quickly or you spend 30+ minutes choosing what to eat in the first place (not including the actual restaurant you are going to).

foodwithfriends is a web application that aims to make decision-making for where to eat easy. Users can invite their entourage to a "room" where they can choose a cuisine they prefer (e.g. Italian, Chinese, etc.), vote on it, and go on to choose a restaurant together.

Instead of wasting time deciding on what and where to eat, foodwithfriends allows you and your friends to share a meal instantly.

## Product Vision Statement

Our goal is to help groups of people choose a dining spot so that more time is spent on being together than deciding on where and what to eat. To accomplish this, our MVP should allow users to create/join group spaces, vote on a cuisine and view the results, add preferred dishes related to the cuisine, and view the list of recommended restaurants in descending order (from most recommended to least, based on user preferences).

## History

The project is proposed by [@Jen-Lopez](https://github.com/Jen-Lopez) for the Agile Development Course. She has always wanted to work on a restaurant finder application **for groups**, as she herself is a picky eater. There are many times where she has held up her own friend group in making decisions on where to eat. So hopefully by building this application, other picky eaters, those with dietary restrictions, or with specific cravings can find somewhere to eat relatively quick and easily.
