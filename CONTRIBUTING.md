# Contribution Guide

Before you join the development, make sure to set up the project on your local machine. Use the [installation guide](./INSTALLATION.md) to get you started. Once you have everything set up, feel free to explore and get familiar with the application. Who knows, you might come up with some new feature ideas along the way! :) 

## Team Norms
### Values
Be respectful to other teammates. If there are interpersonal conflicts, we should resolve it in a civil + peaceful way. 

If you are blocked on a task, feel free to ask for help in our `team-oita` slack channel. Go ahead and **@channel** us if need be!

If we ever are in disagreement, we will vote to reach a consensus on direction.

We should always try to [timebox](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/timebox) our tasks. However, if we ever fall behind on our work obligations, we can ask team members for help and contribute more during the next sprint.

We want to be communicative as possible. So, we will check slack *at least* twice a day to check for messages.

### Sprint Cadence
Sprints will be 2 weeks long.

### Standups
Standups will be ~ 15-20 minutes long and will be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous meetings.

Synchronous standups will be held: 
- Mondays 8PM
- Wednesdays 10PM

Asynchronous standups will be held on saturdays. One team member will start an **Async standup {date} :arrow_down:** thread, where everyone else's updates will be posted within the thread. Individual posts should detail the following: What was worked on, What is next, Any blockers.

## Best Practices
- Use CamelCase variable names. If it is a constant, capitalize it.
- Name your branch after the feature or issue you will work on. Keep it concise.
- Write clear and meaningful commit messages.
- Using VSCode? Try not to include the `.vscode` folder in your commit.
- If working on a UI-related issue, it would be great to include a screenshot(s) of what is going to be rendered.

## Pull Request Process
- Ensure that your code passes our eslint build and that there are no merge conflicts.
- Provide a clear subject title that is related to the issue (e.g. `[Issue #5] Update the Readme`).
- Provide a list of changes the PR addresses.
- Link the PR to the related issue. This way, the issue is closed upon merge.
- PRs must be approved by 2-3 people. If asked, please address any requested changes.
- Once approval is granted, merge the PR and delete the branch that was worked on (unless others are using it).

## Feature Requests
If there is a feature you would like to suggest, feel free to file a new issue so that we can take a look.
